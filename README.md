For index.html:

I minfied the pizzeria image using an online image optimizer: http://www.imageoptimizer.net/Pages/Home.aspx

I assigned classes to elements of the web page, such as paragraphs within lists. This way,
CSS does not have to work so hard to figure out the child of the parent elements.

I minified and inlined the CSS that contributes to the initial page load. Then, I 
inlined that CSS and kept the rest of the CSS in a separate CSS file. 

I put in JavaScript code to make the CSS async so that it dowloads during the idle time.

I inlined code for the google font I needed and then got rid of the link to google fonts at the top.




For the pizza site:

I changed "selectAllQueryElements()" to "getElementsByClassName()"

I simplified the way the code iterates through the pizza elements to change their  widths.

When it came to moving the sliding background pizzas based on scoll position, I stored a calculation in 
in a variable so that the calculation only had to happen once.

We do not need to generate 200 sliding pizzas. I dynamically calculate the number of pizzas using the screen
size.








## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
